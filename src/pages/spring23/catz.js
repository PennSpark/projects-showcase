          One of the biggest challenges was just learning the new software
          (Spline). Many of us are beginners when it comes to 3D, so it was an
          ordeal to learn a completely new software in less than a semester.

          We learned a lot about the challenges of 3D and it was eye-opening to
          see how 3D on the web has progressed.
