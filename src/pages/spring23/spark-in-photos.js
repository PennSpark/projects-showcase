      Spark-in-photos serves as our online photo album–a way of automatically collecting and showcasing all the memories within Spark (and our Slack) in one place."

            One challenge we faced was choosing a decent photo storage cloud
            provider - one that allowed a good upload API while allowing us to
            query efficiently by date. Eventually we chose Cloudinary for its
            ease of use and easy plug-ins.
          </li>
          <li>
            Another challenge we faced was CORS issues trying to directly call
            Cloudinary from our front-end - eventually, we created a proxy
            NodeJS server to make Cloudinary calls!

      takeaways={[
        "We learnt that projects can come in many shapes and forms - this project is more of an internal community gallery, and its back-bone is actually the slack bot that powers the uploads. It was a fun time getting the slack bot to work, and it’ll be just as fun programming more of them in the future. ",
