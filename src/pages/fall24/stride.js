      background="Imagine walking on Locust Walk right after class and you receive a notification on your phone: 'Quick!! Penn SPARK is pie-ing its two directors for charity next to the Quad!' Since you’re Nick and Andre’s friend, you really want to shove some cranberry pie in their nostrils. Seeing that the quad is only 2 minutes away from your current location, you find it convenient to walk to the quad for a quick detour. 'Penn Pins' is a social exploration app designed to help students discover campus and connect with each other in real life. As students walk around, they receive notifications for location-based “pins” dropped by other students and campus organizations—each with recommendations, events, and hidden gems nearby. With only one pin per day, users make each pin meaningful and personalized. Verified organizations can post event pins, turning the campus into a live feed of activities and spontaneous opportunities. Penn Pins is your guide to new spots, events, and connections, all within a short walk."

      challenges={[
        <ul>
          <li>Design challenge: Product pivot: This project began as a social app where users could post pictures and comments only visible at specific locations on campus. However, after the midpoint presentation, we realized that the app didn’t offer compelling value to busy students. After a brief crisis, we puled together a brainstorming session over ramen and snacks, and created a detailed product document outlining the new product’s mission, use case, detailed descriptions of each page, and user flow. Setting clear goals as a team helped us streamline a formerly disorganized vision between designers and product leads, and create a straightforward product that resonates with users’ needs.</li>,
        <li>Tech challenge: Notifications and background functions: Building an app where the primary entry point and main form of user interaction are through notifications proved an unexpected challenge; iOS had strict, unpredictable restrictions on notifications and background functions. </li>
        <li>Misc tech challenges: Google authentication, implementing a real-time/shared/infinitely expanding ‘bulletin board’ with drag-drop items, every dev having to learn React Native/NodeJS on the fly…</li>
        </ul>
    ]}
      takeaways={[
        <ul>
            <li>Consolidating and recording clear, detailed goals on every aspect of the product and making incremental edits as needed instead of only verbally agreeing</li>

<li>Starting with a more lightweight, deployed v0 before implementing more detailed features to keep motivated and fit a shorter project timeline</li>
<li>People are everything! The team held it together despite challenges and had a great time (free food at work sessions helped, too).</li>
</ul>
      ]}
      lookingForward={[
        <p>Deployed, simplified version of the app that is more of a utility-focused product than a fun showcase project. Stretch features: shareable event pins through message/applet, limited-time pin designs and seasonal events, more customization options for notifications.</p>,
