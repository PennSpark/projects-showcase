On the website, we created a few static pages as well as a user profile page. The static pages include landing page, about page, team page, and contact form. The user profile page has a component that displays all the user information such as education and social media links as well as a component that displays a calendar that shows when the user is available. Rachel designed the website and its components using Figma. Marcel and Alex coded the front end application based on the UI mockups.",

              <li>One technical challenge we encountered was making the website responsive. We had to follow the mockups which often did not have the same information as the desktop view.</li>
              <li>Another technical challenge we faced was implementing the calendar functionality. It was complex since we had to work with an api and minimize the number of api calls as possible.</li>

      takeaways={[
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Marcel K</strong>: I think I significantly improved my frontend development skills. I also learned how to communicate with a designer and articulate the feasibility of features.</li>
          <li><strong>Alex Z</strong>: This was my first time working on a team to create a product that hundred of others would use. I learned a lot about communication as well as how to talk to clients.</li>
          <li><strong>Rachel P</strong>: This was a great opportunity to work with multiple stakeholders, the co-founders and the customers, so my communication skills have definitely evolved. This was also a great way to feel the energy, demand, and strategy of a startup.</li>
