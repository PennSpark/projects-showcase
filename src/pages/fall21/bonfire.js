              <li>Client communication: As our clients were peers/Penn students, with busy schedules and difficult course loads, it was difficult to coordinate with and meet with our client to receive feedback and client input on deliverables and design needs.</li>
              <li>Timeline: Because the beta test launch was postponed, we found delays in feedback as well as little user testing. Thus, we had to base our designs on our perception of the prototype.</li>
