On popplex, students inform the instructor that they are confused and how they want the instructor to address it (e.g. “repeat”, “rephrase”, “elaborate”, “provide an example”).  After class, students participate in a short survey that allows them to review what they learned. In turn, the lecturers receive both live and specific aggregate feedback that allows them to continually improve on their lecture.",

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Matthew D</strong>: My biggest takeaway from this project is the importance of planning model schema before beginning development. In planning the schema for the database objects, I saved a lot of effort later down the road as I only had to make minimal changes to the fields. </li>
          <li><strong>Yuhan L</strong>: </li>
          <li><strong>Claire Z</strong>: Some of my takeaways from this project are how important it is to have a framework for how the website is going to look in terms of which views lead to where as the project became a lot easier once we figured this out. This project also taught me a lot about the MVC framework and how each of the components are connected to each other. I am also happy that I finally learned how to use git :D</li>
          <li><strong>Ethan Z</strong>: This was my first time using Django/HTML/CSS in a context that wasn’t just a personal project. My biggest takeaway was just learning full-stack development, as it’s knowledge that I’ve retained and can apply in the future.</li>
